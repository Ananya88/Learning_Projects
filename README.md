This repository is a key part of my journey to <b>re-learn and strengthen my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development skills</b>. I am starting with the fundamentals and progressively working on hands-on projects to solidify my understanding and gain practical experience.

As I continue through my learning path, I am excited to build and experiment with new concepts, focusing on both mastering the theory and applying it in real-world scenarios. This repository will serve as a collection of my learning projects, showcasing my progress as I explore and refine my skills in web development.
