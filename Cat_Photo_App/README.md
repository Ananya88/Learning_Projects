# HTML-learning-projects
This repository is part of my journey to <b>re-learn and reinforce my HTML skills</b>. I'm starting with the fundamentals and gradually building practical projects to solidify my knowledge.

Currently, I am working on <b> a Cat Photo App </b>as part of the Responsive Web Design course from freeCodeCamp. This project allows me to apply what I've learned in HTML to real-world scenarios, providing hands-on experience as I continue to grow my web development skills.

I'm excited to build and experiment with new concepts as I progress through this course, focusing on both learning and practical application.
