# HTML-learning-projects

This project, titled <b>Cat Photo App</b>, is part of the <i>Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp</i>. It serves as a practical application of the HTML skills I have developed throughout the course.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in structuring web pages using HTML, while also learning how to leverage GitHub for version control and project management. This hands-on project allowed me to implement fundamental HTML concepts in a real-world context, and provided me with a deeper understanding of both front-end development and the importance of using version control effectively.

By building the Cat Photo App, I was able to reinforce my knowledge of HTML elements, attributes, and semantic structure, while also gaining a clearer understanding of how to manage and deploy projects using GitHub.
